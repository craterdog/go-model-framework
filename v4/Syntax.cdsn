GO CLASS MODEL NOTATION
This document contains a formal definition of the Go Class Model Notation™
(GCMN) using Crater Dog Syntax Notation™ (CDSN):
 * https://github.com/craterdog/go-grammar-framework/blob/main/v4/cdsn/Syntax.cdsn

A language syntax consists of a set of rule definitions and lexigram
definitions.

The following intrinsic character types are context specific:
 * ANY - Any language specific character.
 * LOWER - Any language specific lowercase character.
 * UPPER - Any language specific uppercase character.
 * DIGIT - Any language specific digit.
 * ESCAPE - Any environment specific escape sequence.
 * CONTROL - Any environment specific (non-printable) control character.
 * EOL - The environment specific end-of-line character.
 * EOF - The environment specific end-of-file marker (pseudo character).

A predicate may be constrained by any of the following cardinalities:
 * predicate{M} - Exactly M instances of the specified predicate.
 * predicate{M..N} - M to N instances of the specified predicate.
 * predicate{M..} - M or more instances of the specified predicate.
 * predicate? - Zero or one instances of the specified predicate.
 * predicate* - Zero or more instances of the specified predicate.
 * predicate+ - One or more instances of the specified predicate.

A negation "~" within a lexigram definition may only be applied to a bounded
range of possible intrinsic character types or printable unicode characters
called runes.

RULE DEFINITIONS
The following rules are used by the parser when parsing the stream of tokens
generated by the scanner based on the lexigram definitions.  Each rule name
begins with an uppercase letter.  The rule definitions may specify the names of
lexigrams or other rules and are matched by the parser in the order listed.  A
rule definition may also be directly or indirectly recursive.  The parsing of
tokens is greedy and will match as many repeated token types as possible. The
sequence of factors within in a rule definition may be separated by spaces which
are ignored by the parser.

LEXIGRAM DEFINITIONS
The following lexigram definitions are used by the scanner to generate the
stream of tokens—each an instance of a lexigram type—that are to be processed by
the parser.  Each lexigram name begins with a lowercase letter.  Unlike with
rule definitions, a lexigram definition cannot specify the name of a rule within
its definition, but it may specify the name of another lexigram.  Lexigram
definitions cannot be recursive and the scanning of lexigrams is NOT greedy.
Any spaces within a lexigram definition are part of the lexigram and are NOT
ignored.
